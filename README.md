Below is a quick-scan “toolbox” of reputable sites that practicing lawyers use in 2025 to pick up freelance or contract work. I’ve grouped them by how they match talent to clients, because each model suits a different career goal or risk tolerance.

### Practical Tips & Ethics Checklist

1. **Bar compliance first** – Check your jurisdiction’s rules on fee-sharing, advertising, and conflicts before you click “Accept.”
2. **Confidentiality & encryption** – Stick to platforms that provide secure doc portals or let you use your own (Box, OneDrive, etc.).
3. **Scope + flat fees win** – Well-scoped, fixed-fee projects avoid billing disputes and collect faster on most platforms.
4. **Ratings matter** – On gig sites, a handful of 5-star reviews can 10× your invite rate.
5. **Mind the taxes** – U.S. 1099s or your local equivalent; many platforms issue year-end summaries but keep your own records.

Use the matrix above to map your goals (income gap-filling, lifestyle flexibility, pathway to in-house) to the marketplace that best fits your practice style. Good luck—and bill happy!
